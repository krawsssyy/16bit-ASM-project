# 16bit-ASM-project

This is a 16bit assembly project that showcases the use of jumps, unconditional jumps and labels to construct a more complex ASM program. It constructs two sequences based on 2 initial sequences given, splitting them into even and odd sequences.
The program then prints them out separating them by '-'.
